# AIML-Internship
# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Mini Project

## 📑 Description
This project predicts the next day's stock closing price using **Linear Regression**.  
It uses multiple real features: Previous Close, High, Low — for more realistic prediction.

## 📂 Dataset
- `stock.csv` — Synthetic Nifty50-style data for Jan–Mar 2025.
- Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

## ⚙️ How it works
1. Loads and preprocesses data.
2. Creates lag features.
3. Splits data properly (past → future).
4. Trains a Linear Regression model.
5. Visualizes Actual vs Predicted.
6. Predicts next day's close price.

## 🚀 How to run
- Open `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all cells step-by-step.
- See the plot and tomorrow’s predicted price!

## ✅ What I learned
- Handling time-series data in ML.
- Feature engineering for regression.
- Visualizing model performance.

## 📌 Status
✔️ Completed as a mini project for my AI/ML Internship.
✔️ Open for future upgrades (LSTM, moving averages, etc.)
